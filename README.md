# Cirrusboard languages
This repository stores language files for Cirrusboard's experimental translation system. Things are subject to change, but the translation system is still good enough to run a non-English forum with Cirrusboard with a bit of work.

Cirrusboard reads translation files in JSON format from `lang/`, which get converted from the PO files used by translators by `update_translations.py`.
